Gauss Computer Programs Chapter 4,
2nd edition Heer/Maussner, Dynamic General Equilibrium Modeling
===============================================================

The files

Ramsey2d.g       
Ramsey3d.g       
Readme_Ch4.txt   
SGNNI_a.g        
SolveDSS.src                 

store the Gauss programs referred to in Chapter 4 of our book.

To use Ramsey2d.g and Ramsey3d.g you must either copy the
code in SolveDSS.src to these files, use an #include SolveDSS.src
command or add the procedures in SolveDSS.src to your user.lcg library.
The procedure GraphSettings which I frequently use to change the Gauss defaults
for graphics output is in the file Tools.src which is included in
the zip archive Ch11_Gauss.zip. 

The programs run under Gauss 7.0 and higher.
